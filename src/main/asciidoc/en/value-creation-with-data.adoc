== 7 roads to data-driven value creation
//ST: 7 roads to data-driven value creation
//ST: !

[IMPORTANT]
====
Not a closed list, not a recipe!

Rather, these are essential building blocks for a strategy of value creation based on data.
====

== 1. PREDICT
//ST: 1. PREDICT

//ST: !
image::prediction.jpg[align="center"]

//ST: !
==== Prediction: The ones doing it

//ST: !
|===

1. Predictive churn / default / ... (banks / telco)

2. Predicting crime image:predpol.png[width="100"]

3. Predicting deals image:tilkee.png[width="100"]

4. Predictive maintenance image:cat.jpg[width="100"]

|===

//ST: !
==== Prediction: the hard part

//ST: !

|===

1. Collecting data (https://indatalabs.com/blog/data-science/cold-start-problem-in-recommender-systems[cold start problem])

2. Risk missing the long tail, algorithmic discrimination, stereotyping

3. Neglect of novelty
|===


== 2. SUGGEST
//ST: 2. SUGGEST
//ST: !

image::suggestion.jpg[align="center"]

//ST: !
==== Suggestion: The ones doing it

//ST: !
|===


1. Amazon’s product recommendation system image:amazon.jpg[width="100"]

2. Google’s “Related searches…” image:google.jpg[width="100"]

3. Retailer’s personalized recommendations image:auchan.jpg[width="100"]

|===

//ST: !
==== Suggestion: the hard part

//ST: !
|===

1. The https://indatalabs.com/blog/data-science/cold-start-problem-in-recommender-systems[cold start problem], managing serendipity (see review: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2016.08.014[paying version], free version not available) and "filter bubble" effects (review: https://doi.org/10.1145/2566486.2568012[paying version], http://wwwconference.org/proceedings/www2014/proceedings/p677.pdf[free version here]).

2. Finding the value proposition which goes beyond the simple “you purchased this, you’ll like that”

|===


== 3. CURATE
//ST: 3. CURATE
//ST: !

image::curation.jpg[align="center"]

//ST: !
==== Curation: The ones doing it

//ST: !
|===

1. Clarivate Analytics curating metadata from scientific publishing image:crv_logo_rgb_rev.png[width="100"]

2. Nielsen and IRI curating and selling retail data image:nielsen.jpg[width="100"] image:iri.jpg[width="100"]

3. ImDB curating and selling movie data image:imdb.jpg[width="100"]

|===

//ST: !
==== Curation: the hard part

//ST: !
|===

1. Slow progress: curation needs human labor to insure high accuracy, it does not scale the way a computerized process would.

2. Must maintain continuity: missing a single year or month hurts the value of the overall dataset disproportionally.

3. Scaling up / right incentives for the workforce: the workforce doing the curation should be paid fairly, which is https://www.wired.com/story/amazons-turker-crowd-has-had-enough/[not the case yet].

4. Quality control

|===


== 4. ENRICH
//ST: 4. ENRICH
//ST: !

image::enrich.jpg[align="center",width="500"]

//ST: !
==== Enrichment: The ones doing it

//ST: !
|===

1. Selling methods and tools to enrich datasets image:watson.png[width="100"]

2. Selling aggregated indicators image:edf.jpg[width="100"]

3. Selling credit scores

|===

//ST: !
==== Enrichment: the hard part

//ST: !
|===

1. Knowing which cocktail of data is valued by the market

2. Limit replicability

3. Establish legitimacy

|===


== 5. RANK / MATCH / COMPARE
//ST: 5. RANK / MATCH / COMPARE
//ST: !

image::rank.jpg[align="center",width="500"]

//ST: !
==== Ranking / matching / comparing: The ones doing it

//ST: !
|===

1. Search engines ranking results image:google.jpg[width="100"]

2. Yelp, Tripadvisor, etc… which rank places image:tripadvisor.jpg[width="100"]

3. Any system that needs to filter out best quality entities among a crowd of candidates

|===

//ST: !
==== Ranking / matching / comparing: the hard part

//ST: !
|===

1. Finding emergent, implicit attributes (imagine: if you rank things based on just one public feature: not interesting nor valuable)

2. Insuring consistency of the ranking (many rankings are less straightforward than they appear)

3. Avoid gaming of the system by the users (for instance, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html[companies try to play Google's ranking of search results at their advantage])

|===


== 6. SEGMENT / CLASSIFY
//ST: 6. SEGMENT / CLASSIFY
//ST: !

image::muffin.jpg[align="center",width="500"]

//ST: !
==== Segmenting / classifying: The ones doing it

//ST: !
|===

1. Tools for discovery / exploratory analysis by segmentation

2. Diagnostic tools (spam or not? buy, hold or sell? healthy or not?) image:medimsight.png[width="100"]

|===

//ST: !
==== Segmenting / classifying: the hard part

//ST: !
|===

1. Evaluating the quality of the comparison

2. Dealing with boundary cases

3. Choosing between a pre-determined number of segments (like in the k-means) or letting the number of segments emerge
