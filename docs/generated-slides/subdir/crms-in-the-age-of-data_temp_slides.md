==  1. Definition of CRM

CRM: acronym for "Customer Relationship Management"

A CRM is a software used to manage the commercial relationship between a company and its clients.

==  !
A CRM is part of the *information system* (IS) of the firm. The information system designates all software, human resources and procedures devoted to keep track of all info necessary to the business of the firm - from sales to production, etc.

==  !

The information system of a firm comprises many other blocks, besides the CRM:

==  !

Large companies often integrate these different blocks into an ERP, which is an even larger software able to plug different parts together.

==  !

The role of CRMs is evolving, and we make the case that "big data" has transformed CRMs radically.

To illustrate, we will compare (and caricature a bit) a CRM from 2000 with a CRM of today:

==  CRMs - before

The name of the CRM - Customer *Relationship* Management suggests a kind of rich, personalized and human touch.

In practice, CRMs where used for more practical purposes:

==  !
We must imagine the CRM software as a tool which *supported the management of sales*, performing these 3 essential functions:

==  !
- measuring revenues, through the recording of sales transactions.
- controlling the performance of the sales persons, by registering which cashier, employee performed the sale, or at least the location of the shop.
- recording VAT collected, which is a legal obligation for tax declaration purposes.

Do you see the customer represented in these functions? Me neither.

==  !

The customer was not completely forgotten: CRM are used to run loyalty programs and campaigns:

==  !
==== a) loyalty programs

==  !

Loyalty programs afford discounts and special offers to its members.

They increase the share-of-wallet of the company implementing them: the amount of the customer's total spending that a business captures in the products and services that it offers.

==  !

A study performed on the loyalty programs run by 7 major supermarket chains in the Netherlands has found that

[quote]
On average, a loyalty program enhances the net yearly revenues of a customer by € 163, but the effects vary between € 91 and € 236

==  !
==== b) Direct mails and coupons

==  !
Customers registered in a CRM with their postal address (after joining a loyalty program) can be sent promotional material and coupons.

Using printed material prohibits the customization to the personal needs of the customers, since a printed catalogue is the same for every recipient.

This decreases the efficiency of direct mail campaigns.

==  3. The digital transformation, 2006-2015

Changes occurring in the past decade have transformed the landscape of the customer relationship. We should realize that for

Data-driven and also curated by editors, customer service specialists and evangelists
