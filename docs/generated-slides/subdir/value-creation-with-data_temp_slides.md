3. Any system that needs to filter out best quality entities among a crowd of candidates

|===

.Rank / Match / Compare: the hard part

3. Avoid gaming of the system by the users

|===


==  5. SEGMENT / CLASSIFY
==  !

.Segment / classify: the ones doing it
|===

1. Tools for discovery / exploratory analysis by segmentation
