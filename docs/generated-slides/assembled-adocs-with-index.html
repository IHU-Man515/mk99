<section id="_definition_of_data"><h2>Definition of data</h2></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>The English term "data" (1654) originates from  "datum", a Latin word for "a given"<sup>1</sup>.
"Data" is a single factual, a single entity, a single point of matter.
The word "data" to mean "transmittable and storable computer information" was first used in this sense in 1946.
The expression "data processing" was first used in 1954.</p></div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip"><table><tr><td class="icon"><div class="title"></div></td><td class="content"><div class="paragraph"><p>Thoughts: the etymology suggests that data is "a given". Can you question this?</p></div></td></tr></table></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Data represents either a single entity, or a collection of such entities ("data points").
We can speak also of datasets instead of data (so a dataset is a collection of data points).</p></div></section>

<div class="paragraph"><p>These examples are chosen on purpose to be varied and from unexpected places.
They illustrate three principles:</p></div></section>
<section><h3>a. Think about data in a broad sense</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Data is not just numerical, neither is it "what sits in my spreadsheets". You should train in thinking about data in a broader sense:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>pictures are data</p></li><li><p>language is data (including slang, lip movements, etc.)</p></li><li><p>relations are data: individual A is known, individual B is known, <strong>but the relationship between A and B is data as well</strong></p></li><li><p>preferences, emotional states&#8230;&#8203; are data</p></li><li><p>etc. There is no definitive list, you should train yourself looking at business situations and think: "where is the data?"</p></li></ul></div></section>
<section><h3>b. metadata is data, too</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Metadata  is a piece of data describing another data.
Example:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock"><div class="content"><pre class="CodeRay"><code>The bibliographical reference <b>(1)</b>
describing
a book <b>(2)</b></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="colist arabic"><ol><li><p>the metadata</p></li><li><p>the data</p></li></ol></div></section>
<section><h3>c. zoom in, zoom out</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>We should remember considering that a data point can be itself a collection of data points:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>a person walking into a building is a data point.</p></li><li><p>however this person is itself a collection of data points: location data + network relations + subscriber status to services + etc.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is a good reflex to wonder whether a data point can in fact be "unbundled" (spread into smaller data points / measurements)</p></div></section>
<section id="_how_to_describe_datasets"><h2>How to describe datasets</h2></section>
<section><h3>a. Formats, types, encoding</h3></section>
<section><div class="imageblock stretch" style="text-align: center"><img src="images/tweet.png" alt="tweet" height="100%" /></div></section>
<section><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>This is a digital <strong>medium</strong> (because it&#8217;s on screen as opposed to analogical, if we had printed the pic on paper)</p></li><li><p>The <strong>type</strong> of the data is textual + image</p></li><li><p>The text is formatted in <strong>plain text</strong> (meaning, no special formatting), as opposed to <strong>data-interchange formats</strong> which are formatting marks added to the text to facilitate its readability by software (check csv, json and xml<sup>3</sup>).</p></li><li><p>The <strong>encoding</strong>  of the text is UTF-8 (one of encodings deriving from the Unicode standard). Encoding deals with the issue: how to represent alphabets, signs (for instance: emojis) and symbols, from different languages, in text? UTF-8 is an encoding which is one of the most universal.</p></li><li><p>The tweet is part of a list of tweets. The list represents the <strong>data structure</strong>  of the dataset, it is the way the data is organized. There are many alternative data structures: arrays, sets, dics, maps&#8230;&#8203;</p></li><li><p>The tweet is stored as a picture (png file) on the hard disk. "png" is the <strong>file format</strong>. The data is <strong>persisted</strong> as a file on disk (could have been stored in a database instead).</p></li></ul></div></section>
<section><h3>b. Tabular data</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Tabular data</strong>  is a common way to handle datasets, by organizing it in lines and columns:</p></div></section>
<section><div class="imageblock stretch" style="text-align: center"><img src="images/table.png" alt="table" height="100%" /></div><div class="title">Figure 1. tabular data</div></section>
<section><h3>c. First party, second party and third party data</h3></section>
<section><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p><strong>First party data</strong> : the data generated through the activities of your own organization.
Your organization own it, which does not mean that consent from users is not required, when it comes to personal data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Second party data</strong>  : the data accessed through partnerships.
Without being the generator nor the owner of this data, partners make it available to you through an agreement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Third party data</strong> : the data acquired via purchase.
This data is acquired through a market transaction. Its uses still comes with conditions, especially for personal data.</p></li></ul></div></section>
<section><h3>d. Sociodemo data vs behavior data</h3></section>
<section><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Sociodemogaphic or <strong>sociodemio</strong>  data refers to information about individuals, describing fundamental attributes of their social identity: age, gender, place of residence, occupation, marital status and number of kids.</p></li><li><p><strong>Behavior data</strong>  refers to any digital trace left by the individual in the course of it life: clicks on web pages, likes on Facebook, purchase transactions, comments posted on Tripadvisor&#8230;&#8203;
Sociodemo data is typically well structured or easy to structure.
It has a long history of collection and analysis, basically since census exists.
Behavior data  allows to profile individuals much more precisely than sociodemo data alone could do: individuals can be characterized by their acts and tastes, well beyond what an age or marital status could define.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>How can behavior data "beat" sociodemo data for precision?
It is hard to predict with great accuracy the political, religious or sexual orientation of a given individual just based on their zip code, gender and age. A research team could evaluate personal attributes with great precision based on the likes individuals make on Facebook  pages and posts<sup>4</sup>. Political orientation (85% accuracy), sexual orientation (75% to 88% accuracy) and religious orientation (82% accuracy) can be determined for persons who had made 170 likes on average.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But behavior data is typically not well structured, which makes it more costly to collect, in term of technological solution, than it costs to collect sociodemo data. The power and accuracy of prediction that behavior data affords also means that individuals should be protected against the possible invasion of their privacy. There are large differences between countries regarding the legal frameworks protecting individuals rights. We discuss this in the chapter on data privacy and the GDPR.</p></div></section>

<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Jokes aside, defining big data and what it covers needs a bit of precision. Let&#8217;s bring some clarity.</p></div></section>
<section id="_the_3_v"><h2>The 3 V</h2></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Big data is usually described with the "3 Vs":</p></div></section>
<section><h3><strong>V</strong> for Volume</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>The size of datasets available today is staggering (ex: Facebook had 250 billion pics in 2016).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We should also note that the volumes of data are increasing at an <strong>accelerating rate</strong>. According to sources, 90% of all the data in the world has been generated over the last two years<sup>5</sup> (statement from 2013) or said differently, more data will be created in 2017 than the previous 5,000 years of humanity<sup>6</sup>.</p></div></section>
<section><h3><strong>V</strong> for Variety</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>"Variety" refers to the fact that "unstructured" data is considered to be increasingly useful, when before the big data phenoenon only structured data was considered worth storing and exploiting. This calls to explain in more details the distinction between unstructured and structured data.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p></p></div>
<h3>A - Structured data</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Structured data</strong>  refers to data which is formatted and organized according to a well defined set of rules, which makes it <strong>machine readable</strong>. For example, zip codes are a structured dataset because they follow a precise convention regarding the number of letters and digits composing them, making it easy for an optical reader and software to identify and "read" them. Same with license plates, social security numbers&#8230;&#8203;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But these are simple examples.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What about, for instance, a tax form? If each field of the form is well defined, then the data collected through the form can be said to be "structured". By contrast, a form where the user can write free text (think of a comment on a blog post, or a blank space where users can write a feedback) produces unstructured data: data which does not follow a special convention for its size and content. This is typically much harder for software to process, hence to analyze.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To summarize, think of structured data as as anything that can be represented as well organized tables of numbers and short pieces of text with the expected format, size, and conventions of writing: phonebooks, accounting books, governmental statistics&#8230;&#8203;</p></div></section>
<section><div class="imageblock stretch" style="text-align: center"><img src="images/book.png" alt="book" height="100%" /></div><div class="title">Figure 3. A book of accounts showing structured data</div></section>
<section><h3>B - Unstructured data</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Unstructured data</strong>  refers to datasets made of "unruly" items: text of any length, without proper categorization, encoded in different formats, including possibly pictures, sound, geographical coordinates and what not&#8230;&#8203;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These datasets are much harder to process and analyze, since they are full of exceptions and differences. But they are carry typically rich information: free text, information recorded "in the wild"&#8230;&#8203;</p></div></section>
<section><div class="imageblock stretch" style="text-align: center"><img src="images/unstructured-data.png" alt="unstructured data" height="100%" /></div><div class="title">Figure 4. Structured vs unstructured data</div></section>
<section><h3><strong>V</strong> for Velocity</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>In a nutshell, the speed of creation and communication of data is accelerating<sup>7</sup>:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Facebook  hosts 250 billion pics? It receives 900 million more pictures <strong>per day</strong></p></li><li><p>Examining tweets can be done automatically (with computers). If you want to connect to Twitter to receive tweets in real time as they are tweeted, be prepared to receive in excess of 500 million tweets <strong>per day</strong>. Twitter calls this service the "Twitter firehose"<sup>8</sup>, which reflects the velocity of the stream of tweets.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sensor data</strong>  is bound to increase speed as well. While pictures, tweets, individual records&#8230;&#8203; are single item data sent at intervals, more and more sensors can send data <strong>in a continuous stream</strong> (measures of movement, sound, etc.)</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, velocity poses challenges of its own: while a system can handle (store, analyze) say 100Gb of data in a given time (day or month), it might not be able to do it in say, a single second. Big data refers to the problems and solutions raised by the velocity of data.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>A 4th <strong>V</strong> can be added, for Veracity</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Veracity relates to trustworthiness and compliance: is the data authentic? Has it been corrupted at any step of its processing? Does it comply with local and international regulations?</p></div></section>
<section id="_what_is_the_minimum_size_to_count_as_big_data_it_s_all_relative"><h2>What is the minimum size to count as "big data"? It&#8217;s all relative</h2></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>There is no "threshold" or "minimum size" of a dataset where "data" would turn from "small data" to "big data".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is more of a <strong>relative</strong> notion: it is big data if current IT systems struggle to cope with the datasets.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"Big data" is a relative notion&#8230;&#8203; how so?</p></div></section>
<section><h3>a. relative to time</h3></section>
<section><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>what was considered "big data" in the early 2000s would be considered "small data" today, because we have better storage and computing power today.</p></li><li><p>this is a never ending race: as IT systems improve to deal with "current big data", data gets generated in still larger volumes, which calls for new progress / innovations to handle it.</p></li></ul></div></section>
<section><h3>b. relative to the industry</h3></section>
<section><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>what is considered "big data" by non tech SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) can be considered trivial to handle by tech companies.</p></li></ul></div></section>
<section><h3>c. not just about size</h3></section>
<section><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>the difficulty for an IT system to cope with a dataset can be related to the size (try analyzing 2 Tb of data on your laptop&#8230;&#8203;), <strong>but also</strong> related to the content of the data.</p></li><li><p>For example the analysis of customer reviews in dozens of languages is harder than the analysis of the same number of reviews in just one language.</p></li><li><p>So the general rule is: the less the data is structured, the harder it is to use it, even if it&#8217;s small in size (this relates to the "V" of variety seen above).</p></li></ul></div></section>
<section><h3>d. no correlation between size and value</h3></section>
<section><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>"Big data is often called the new oil"<sup>9</sup>, as if it would flow like oil and would power engines "on demand".</p></li><li><p>Actually, big data is <strong>created</strong>: it needs work, conception and design choices to even exist (what do I collect? how do I store it? what structure do I give to it?). The human intervention in creating data determines largely whether data will be of value later.</p></li><li><p>Example: Imagine customers can write online reviews of your products. These reviews are data.
But if you store these reviews without an indication of who has authored the review (maybe because reviews can be posted without login oneself), then the reviews become much less valuable.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Simple design decisions about how the data is collected, stored and structured have a huge impact on the value of the data.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, in reaction to large, unstructured and badly curated datasets with low value at the end, a notion of "smart data" is sometimes put forward: data which can be small in size but which is well curated and annotated, enhancing its value (see also here<sup>10</sup>).</p></div></section>

<section><h3>d. The mindset changed as to what "counts" as data</h3></section>
<section><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Unstructured data  (see above for definition of "unstructured") was usually not stored: it takes a lot space, and software to query it was not sufficiently developped.</p></li><li><p>Network data (also known as graphs) (who is friend with whom, who likes the same things as whom, etc.) was usually neglected as "not true observation", and hard to query. Social networks like Facebook  made a lot to make businesses aware of the value of graphs (especially social graphs<sup>11</sup>).</p></li><li><p>Geographical data has democratized: specific (and expensive) databases existed for a long time to store and query "place data" (regions, distances, proximity info&#8230;&#8203;) but easy-to-use solutions have multiplied recently.</p></li></ul></div></section>
<section><h3>e. With open source software, the rate of innovation accelerated</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>In the late 1990s, a rapid shift in the habits of software developers kicked in: they tended to use more and more open source software, and to release their software as open source.
Until then, most of the software was "closed source": you buy a software <strong>without the possibility</strong> to reuse / modify / augment its source code. Just use it as is.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Open source</strong>  software made it easy to get access to software built by others and use it to develop new things. Today, all the most popular software in machine learning are free and open source.</p></div>

<section><div class="paragraph"><p>This graph shows the pattern that all technologies follow along their lifetime:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>at the beginning (left of the graph), an invention or discovery is made in a research lab, somewhere. Some news reporting is done about it, but with not much noise.</p></li><li><p>then, the technology starts picking the interest of journalists, consultant, professors, industries&#8230;&#8203; expectations grow about the possibilities and promises of the tech. "With it we will be able to [insert amazing thing here]"</p></li><li><p>the top of the bump is the "peak of inflated expectations". All techs tend to be hyped and even over hyped. This means the tech is expected to deliver more than it surely will, in actuality. People get overdrawn.</p></li><li><p>then follows the "Trough of Disillusionment". Doubt sets in. People realize the tech is not as powerful, easy, cheap or quick to implement as it first seemed. Newspapers start reporting depressing news about the tech, some bad buzz spreads.</p></li><li><p>then: slope of Enlightenment. Heads get colder, expectations get in line with what the tech can actually deliver. Markets stabilize and consolidate: some firms close and key actors continue to grow.</p></li><li><p>then: plateau of productivity. The tech is now mainstream.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>(all technology can "die" - fall into disuse - before reaching the right side of the graph of course).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In 2014, big data was near the top of the curve: it was getting a lot of attention but its practical use in 5 to 10 years were still uncertain. There were "great expectations" about its future, and these expectations drive investment, research and business in big data.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In 2017, "big data" is still on top of hyped technologies, but is broken down in "deep learning" and "machine learning". Note also the "Artificial General Intelligence" category:</p></div></section>

<section><div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Internet of things</strong>  designates the extension of Internet to objects beyond web pages or emails<sup>15</sup>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>IoT</strong>  is used to <strong>do</strong> things (display information on screen, pilote robots, etc.) but also very much to <strong>collect data</strong> in their environments, through sensors.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Hence, the development of <strong>connected objects</strong>  will lead to a tremendous increase in the volume of data collected.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>b. Regulatory frameworks will grow in complexity</h3></section>

<section><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>It is interesting to note that "hot" expressions, like "big data", tend to wear out fast. They are too hyped, used in all circumstances, become vague and over sold.

<section><div class="paragraph"><p>To understand the cloud precisely, We need first to have a clear vision of what a server is. A server is simply a computer stripped of everything unessential (screen, mouse, graphic card, sound card, keyboard)&#8230;&#8203;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To illustrate: when Google is calculating what the best results are for your search "what are cheap and delicious restaurants in Lyon", this calculation must be done on a computer, right?</p></div>

They take too much space, consume energy, and there is no need for them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So when all the unnecessary parts are removed, the computer looks like this, and is called a "server":</p></div></section>

<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Take a look at the shape: rectangular and very slim.
This makes it easy to stack up servers one on the other.
Because for Google and other companies crunching data for their business, a lot of servers are needed, so gaining on space is a real issue.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When many servers are piled up together and put in a big tall box, this is called a <strong>rack</strong>  of servers, and look like this:</p></div></section>

<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>buying their own servers and using them on their premises (at their location).</p></li><li><p>paying the services of companies specializing in managing data centers.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then the "cloud" changed this.</p></div></section>
<section id="_the_cloud"><h2>The cloud</h2></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>The term <strong>cloud</strong>  was made popular by Amazon with their service “Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud”: <strong>Amazon EC2</strong>  launched in 2006.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This service was new in many ways:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>you can rent servers owned by Amazon, at a distance, when you need them, for a duration that you choose.</p></li><li><p>there is an emphasis on ease of use: no need to know the technical details of these servers (how they are plugged, how they are configured…)</p></li><li><p>you are just given a login + password and you can start using these servers for your needs.</p></li><li><p>it&#8217;s "elastic": if you need more servers, or more powerful servers, it&#8217;s just possible. No need for signing a new contract or to evaluate whether Amazon has the capacity&#8230;&#8203; it&#8217;s dimensioned to be possible.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s compare a situation with or without the cloud:</p></div>

Opex are not inherently a better or cheaper option than a Capex, but they are easier for a project team or business unit to fit in their budget.

<section id="_iaas_paas_saas"><h2>IaaS, PaaS, Saas</h2></section>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The cloud is used to replace the company&#8217;s local IT infrastructure needs such storing data, or computing operations.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Platform as a Service</strong> (Paas)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The cloud is used to run the building blocks of a service: to manage a messaging system, to host apps, &#8230;&#8203;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Software as a Service</strong> (Saas)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The cloud is used to host a full software accessible "on demand" through the browser.

<section id="_private_or_public_cloud_hybrid_cloud"><h2>Private or public cloud? Hybrid cloud?</h2></section>
<section><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Amazon EC2  is an example of a <strong>public cloud</strong>: it is publicly accessible to any customer. Of course, this does not mean that every customer can see what the others are doing on the cloud! Each customer have their private spaces on the cloud.</p></li><li><p>Many companies have security requirements which prevent them from accessing public clouds.
They need to have their servers on premises.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this case, they can build their own <strong>private cloud</strong>: it is a cloud just like Amazon EC2, except that it is owned, managed and used by the company exclusively - it is not accessible to third parties.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But even private, the cloud keeps the basic characteristics of a cloud: on-demand and elastic in particular.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p><strong>Hybrid clouds</strong> are a variety of private clouds: it is a private cloud where some forms of operations can be delegated to a public cloud.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, operations which are not security sensitive and which need a capacity of computing in excess of what the private cloud of the company can provide.</p></div></section></section>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Take away: Data is fragmented by nature. It comes from different sources and presented in different formats.
<strong>You</strong> (the marketer in collaboration with data scientists) wrangle to <em>construct</em> customer profiles by joining and assembling different sources of data into a meaningful synthesis.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Data scientists actually have entire books devoted to the subject of wrangling with the complexity of integrating different data sources.</p></div></section>
<section id="_sources_of_fragmentation"><h2>Sources of fragmentation</h2></section>
<section><h3>a. Channels keep diversifying</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Point of sale, print, TV, radio, outdoor posters, mobile apps, mobile sites, emails, SMS, APIs, social networks, search engines, e-commerce platforms, e-commerce websites, blogs, content channels, …</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8594; all these channels can provide relevant data.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>b. Connections between these channels intensify and complexify</h3></section>
<section><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Social TV is TV delivered with Internet services,</p></li><li><p>User profiles created on one platform are imported on another</p></li><li><p>Orders taken online can be picked up on a variety of point of sales</p></li><li><p>Ads circulating through one channel replicate on other channels, &#8230;&#8203;</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8594; It is very complex to trace the "customer journey" on all these channels and to keep an updated view of a customer profile.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is even more difficult to explore causality (which action on which channel caused which subsequent action by the user?)</p></div></section>
<section><h3>c. Underlying technologies fragment and keep evolving, across channels</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Browsers, Cookies, APIs, mobile OS (Android or iOS?), etc&#8230;&#8203; All these different techs evolve and need continuous effort and expertise to integrate.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Example: <strong>did you notice</strong> that on a mobile device, the url of the pages you visit can now start with an AMP url<sup>22</sup>?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Like, to visit the page of the New York Times the url should be <a href="http://www.nyt.com" class="bare">http://www.nyt.com</a> but it looks like: <strong><a href="http://google.com/amp/www.nyt.com" class="bare">http://google.com/amp/www.nyt.com</a></strong></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This <strong><a href="http://google.com/amp" class="bare">http://google.com/amp</a></strong> prefix is a new tech by Google to accelerate the display of web pages on mobiles. Fine.
But then, as a marketing data analyst, how to count visits to:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="http://google.com/amp/www.nyt.com" class="bare">http://google.com/amp/www.nyt.com</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="http://www.nyt.com" class="bare">http://www.nyt.com</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8594; It is important to count visits to these two urls as a visit <strong>to the same page</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In September 2017 major services of web analytics were still struggling with this  issue of page counts in web analytics<sup>23</sup>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This illustrates that to just count visits to a web page (something which should be classic and robust) and integrate this data to a larger analysis, big issues can arise and be hard to fix even in 2017, because of the evolution of techs and standards.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>d. In the meantime, customers have growing expectations about the quality of service</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Difficulties posed by data integration do not slow or decrease customer expectations.
To the contrary, we see an elevation of expectations.
Customers increasingly expect:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>realtime contact</p></li><li><p>two-ways interaction (they want to be able to voice their opinion, and get a response)</p></li><li><p>seamless experience (no glitch, modern user interface, consistence of the user experience across channels)</p></li><li><p>personalized experience (customization of the message they receive)</p></li></ul></div></section>

<section id="_definition_of_api"><h2>Definition of API</h2></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>API: acronym for <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong> </p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>An API is the way to make software programs “easy to plug and share” with other programs.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>An API  is simply a group of rules (you can also call it a convention, or an agreement&#8230;&#8203;) which programmers follow when writing the part of their code which is in charge of communicating with other software.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These rules are then published (on a webpage for example), so that anyone who needs to connect to the program can learn what rules to follow.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, an API  is simply a way to write code to make it easy to interface with other programs? Yes. Why the fuss then?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Having conventions on how to write a software so that somebody can plug it to its own software is one thing.
APIs  as an aspect of software design<sup>25</sup> is a classic topic in computer science, but we are not concerned with this here.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>APIs  we are going to discuss are about communication between distant computers, in a business context.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s do a bit of history:</p></div></section>
<section id="_the_origin_of_apis"><h2>The origin of APIs</h2></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Companies which need to exchange data is nothing new.
Manufacturers, retailers, banks, &#8230;&#8203; they need to exchange information at regular interval.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sending invoices, receiving receipts for merchandise, and many other administrative records generated in the course of business.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These receipts, invoices&#8230;&#8203; can be printed and mailed (this solution still exists of course).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With informatics developing in the 1970s and 1980s, a new system emerged: the exchange of information via computers: Electronic Data Interchange<sup>26</sup> (EDI)</p></div></section>
<section><h3>a. EDI: Electronic Data Interchange</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>EDI  is not an exchange of file attachments in emails or via a file transfer on a website, because emails and websites did not exist yet! (emails and the Web were adopted by firms in the late 1990s).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Instead, exchanging data via EDI  consisted in using complex electronic tools (like the fax but even more complicated) because:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>each industry has its own protocol to exchange data (one protocol for logistics, one for payments, one for this or that retailer chain, etc.)</p></li><li><p>you need a dedicated device or software for each EDI  protocol, and these are not given for free</p></li><li><p>EDI  protocols can vary from one country to another</p></li><li><p>EDI  protocols are controlled by industry associations which do not adopt innovation quickly</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and finally, EDI  protocols created "closed systems": a company A can connect to company B via an EDI  only if the two have a pre-agreement to use this EDI.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So EDIs are fragmented, complicated to implement, slow to evolve, not cheap and restricts the communication to a "club" of partners who agreed to use it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>EDIs still exist<sup>27</sup>, especially in large B2B industries like transportation, but it lost in popularity in the wider economy because&#8230;&#8203;  APIs  have arrived.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>b. The emergence of web APIs</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Internet and the World Wide Web expanded dramatically.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>More and more servers in different parts of the world needed to be interfaced with each other to exchange data.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It became increasingly convenient to define simple and universal conventions that everyone could learn and follow to standardize these exchanges, for free and easily.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That&#8217;s what <strong>web APIs</strong> do. They are also often called:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p><strong>API</strong> for short</p></li><li><p><strong>web services</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>REST</strong> API  (see below for this last one).</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A <strong>web API</strong>  extends the logic of the APIs we have seen in the beginning of this document, to software communicating via the web.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To recall, an API  is a convention followed when writing a software, making this software available to other software.</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl><dt class="hdlist1">NOTE</dt><dd><p>Example: the API  of Microsoft PowerPoint enables the import of Excel tables in pptx documents, because the API  of Powerpoint plugs to the API  of Excel. In this example Excel and Powerpoint are suposed to be installed on the same computer of course!</p></dd></dl></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A Web API  is an API  which enables two pieces of software to communicate, via Internet. <strong>They don&#8217;t need to be installed on the same computer.</strong></p></div></section>
<section><h3>c. The benefits of a web API compared to an EDI</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Unlike an <strong>EDI</strong> , a web API drops any industry-specific concern. Web APIs are just a convention to send and receive data over the Internet, without any saying on the content of the data.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The data sent and received can be invoices, webpages, train schedules, audio, video&#8230;&#8203; whatever.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Contrary to an EDI, a company creating a web API  can choose to leave its access open (remember that EDIs need the two parties to have a pre-established agreement).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So that a potential client interested in using the web API  of a company can set it up in a couple of clicks, instead of waiting weeks or months before a contract is signed and the EDI is setup.</p></div>
<div class="admonitionblock warning"><table><tr><td class="icon"><div class="title"></div></td><td class="content"><div class="paragraph"><p>Saying that APIs are open does not mean an absence of security : communication through APIs can easily be identified and encrypted, as needed.</p></div></td></tr></table></div></section>
<section><h3>d. REST API?</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Two popular web API  conventions emerged in the 1990s and competed for popularity:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol<sup>28</sup>)</p></li><li><p>REST (Representational State Transfer<sup>29</sup>)</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>REST APIs</strong>  became ultimately the most widely adopted, because it uses the same simple principles that webpages use to be transferred over the Internet (the "http" protocol that you see in web page addresses).
This is why APIs  are often called "REST APIs, presented in this pedagogical video"<sup>30</sup>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In 2000-2010, it became increasingly easy and natural to adopt the REST convention to make one&#8217;s software and data available to another computer.
This simple evolution to ease interoperability had <strong>immense effects</strong>:</p></div></section>
<section id="_business_consequences_of_apis"><h2>Business consequences of APIs</h2></section>
<section><h3>a. APIs <strong>opened</strong> software to the world</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>An API  transforms a closed software into something that can be plugged to anything other computer or object, as long as it is connected to the Internet.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For instance, APIs  were a key factor of success for SalesForce<sup>31</sup> in the early 2000s. SalesForce, created in 1999, has a revenue of US$8.39 billion in 2017:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>SalesForce developed a CRM as a SaaS where features of the CRM were <strong>exposed as APIs</strong> (meaning, these features could be plugged to external apps via the REST protocol).</p></li><li><p>SalesForce  created a PaaS to host apps that could plug to the SalesForce  CRM via the APIs developed by SalesForce.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This platform is called Force.com<sup>32</sup> and external developers can put their apps there, as long as they are compatible with the SalesForce  API.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>SalesForce  takes a commission on the sales made by these third party apps hosted on Force.com, but more importantly, the platform creates an <strong>ecosystem</strong> of apps and developers around the SalesForce  products which makes it hard for a customer company to switch to a different product.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>b. APIs <strong>accelerated</strong> software innovation</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks to API  it is now easier to add software blocks together and create new apps, even if these software blocks originate from different countries, industries, big and small.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As an extreme example: the Australian Victoria Police deployed a project for the recognition of stolen vehicles through the video recognition of licence plates on cars passing in the street (stolen vehicles get their license plates immediately recognized). This is a $86,000,000 project. An individual actually replicated this project with just 57 lines of code and a dashcam<sup>33</sup>. How so? Just because he could use existing software for licence plate recognition, available as an API, instead of re-developing this by himself. [Check this amazing story].</p></div></section>
<section><h3>c. APIs <strong>opened</strong> data</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Companies and public organization own many datasets of great business interest.
The use of these datasets can be free (for small projects and NGOs) or monetized if the user is an enterprise.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Without APIs, datasets can be made publicly available as docs (eg, Excel spreadsheets) to download but this is not practical (try downloading something like <code>all_train_schedules_2000_to_2017.xls</code> !).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, imagine a transportation company like French SNCF which finds it interesting to publish station names, train schedules, etc. because it could be used by other companies to build new services : how can it do it?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The data is on a server of SNCF. Then SNCF adds an API  and its documentation<sup>34</sup>, making the data available to developers able to connect to APIs, which is a basic skill in software development<sup>35</sup>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Entrepreneurs and programmers in general will be able to access the data via the API  and use it, possibly to create new services based on this train information.
<strong>Open data</strong>  designates this movement to make datasets available to a broad audience, and web APIs have been a key technological ingredient in this movement.</p></div></section>
<section id="_the_ecosystem_of_apis"><h2>The ecosystem of APIs</h2></section>
<section><h3>a. A wealth of APIs</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>To discover new APIs, or to make your APIs  easier to discover, the most well known place is the website "Programmable Web"<sup>36</sup> (see also apis.io<sup>37</sup>):</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Searching on this website, you will find  APIs  providing business services<sup>38</sup>, or   APIs  of a fun and odd sort<sup>39</sup>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Still, many APIs are not listed on this website, and a google search for "info I need + API" is also a good way to find if the API  you&#8217;d need exists. Interested in whale sightings? There is an API  for that<sup>40</sup>.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>b. APIs: a business world of its own</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>APIs</strong>  have become central to the economy.
As a result, a large number of services associated to APIs  have developed to cater for all the needs of companies that use them:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>how to create an API</p></li><li><p>how to manage the documentation of a large number of APIs</p></li><li><p>how to connect a wide variety of APIs</p></li><li><p>how to control and audit the security of APIs</p></li><li><p>how to monetize and API&#8230;&#8203;</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8594; Many large firms and startups now specialize in all these different issues.

<section id="_when_is_personal_information_considered_data"><h2>When is personal information considered "data"?</h2></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>At the most basic level, anything could count as "data" with possibly a personal character to it, including comments written about somebody in a personal notebook.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In practice, "data" starts to to be considered as such when:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is information capable of being processed <strong>automatically</strong></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8594; Hint: data on computers, not unstructured written notes</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Or</strong> information intended to be processed automatically</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8594; Hint: paper records to be fed in a computer (eg, via scanning), not any pile of paper on your desk.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Or <strong>structured information</strong> that can be used to facilitate the retrieval of specific information on specific individuals</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8594; Hint: paper records, filing systems, databases</p></div></section>
<section id="_personal_data_matters_because_of_privacy"><h2>Personal data matters because of privacy</h2></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Definition of personal data<sup>42</sup>:</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p>Personal data are any anonymous data that can be double checked to identify a specific individual (e.g. fingerprints, DNA, or information such as “the son of the doctor living at 11 Belleville St. in Montpellier does not perform well at school”).</p></div></blockquote><div class="attribution">&#8212; CNIL (French Independent Administrative Authority)</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Personal data is data that an individual has the right to keep private. <strong>How and why is privacy an issue</strong>?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Privacy is mentioned in the Article 12 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights<sup>43</sup>:</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.</p></div></blockquote><div class="attribution">&#8212; Universal Declaration of Human Rights</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This article from the Declaration is found in similar forms in most of the conventions on human rights in the world.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This <strong>right to privacy</strong>  enables individuals to define their identity in relation to the world, by giving each individual the power to control what to keep for themselves, and what to reveal / share with the world.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In 2005, a report on Privacy in the Digital Environment<sup>44</sup> by the Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology develops:</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p>The right to privacy  is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity.</p></div></blockquote></div>
<div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p>The right to privacy  gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.</p></div></blockquote></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In addition to shaping an individual&#8217;s own personal sphere and identity, privacy also underpins the development of a relation between the individual and the society she is part of:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8594; when an individual&#8217;s privacy is secured, they don&#8217;t have to fear that their personal opinions and activities (as simple as reading a newspaper) will endanger them as citizens.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8594; this gives liberty to individuals to develop political expressions which do not necessarily conform with the power structure in place. This would be much harder if everyone&#8217;s political opinions could not be kept private.</p></div></section>
<section id="_evolution_of_privacy"><h2>Evolution of privacy</h2></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Privacy is a social norm which transforms as societies evolve. Since the 2000s, a couple of tendencies can be identified:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>increasing tracking of the digital traces left by individuals by companies which use these traces for ad targeting and data reselling.</p></li><li><p>increasing state surveillance through digital means, against security threats and unspecified goals.</p></li><li><p>broader public acceptance of new forms of violations to privacy.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, TV shows where participants are filmed 24/24<sup>45</sup> and where they reveal their (real or supposed) intimacy, dates back only from the late 1990s.</p></div></section>

<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Journalists, academics, activists and NGOs such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation<sup>47</sup> make the case that:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>consumers are insufficiently aware and sensitive of how much information is captured in the normal conduct of their lives, just by using mobile phones and apps, web browsing, and increasingly in public places.</p></li><li><p>citizens are insufficiently aware and sensitive of the breach of their privacy by security agencies of their own country of residence, and by other countries.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Many citizens consider that if they don&#8217;t break the law, then they have "nothing to hide".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Similarly, consumers might find that bargaining their private data against a free service and some targeted ads, is a good deal.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sociologist of technology Zeynep Tufekci<sup>48</sup> goes further:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Her argument is that besides "surveillance" and "lack of privacy", companies like Google and Facebook  developing a business model based on ad targeting by analytics on personal data, design a <strong>persuasion architecture</strong> which can be used / highjacked for political purposes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Tufekci</strong>  does not argue that Google, Facebook or the likes inherently have anti-democratic purposes, but that:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>they develop of an information architecture which has the potential to shape opinions of crowds,</p></li><li><p>they do so without transparency</p></li><li><p>some past experiments on voting in the US, and current developments on electronic surveillance in China, show that the power of these technologies has already consequences in the real world:</p></li></ul></div></section>

<section id="_evolution_of_data_protection_regulations_in_the_eu"><h2>Evolution of data protection regulations in the EU</h2></section>
<section><h3>a. The Directive on Data Protection by the EU in 1995</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>This Directive derives from earlier guidelines adopted by the OECD as far back as 1980 on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data<sup>51</sup>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These guidelines were adopted by OECD members but were non binding: for instance, the US did not translate the OECD guidelines on the protection of privacy into their legislation<sup>52</sup>. In contrast, these guidelines were turned into a Directive in the EU, in 1995.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>full text of the EU Directive on Data Protection<sup>53</sup></p></li><li><p>Wikipedia presentation of the EU Directive on Data Protection on<sup>54</sup></p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This Directive guarantees and facilitates the free movement of personal data across EU States, by providing a framework valid for all member States for the protection of personal data of EU citizens.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>How is handled the issue of EU data owned by non EU companies? For example, what is the level of protection for the personal data of a French individual, owned by a US company on a server located in the US?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8594; According to the 1995 Directive, th rule was simple: <strong>it is forbidden to export personal data to a non EU-country with a lower level of personal data protection.</strong></p></div></section>
<section><h3>b. The case of EU citizen data hosted by US-based companies</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>The case is important as major providers of services involving personal data (google search, gmail, gmaps, facebook, etc.) is hosted in the US.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The question is: what it the level of data protection in this case? US-level of protection or EU?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It should not be possible to host EU citizen personal data in the US because the US have much less stringent regulations in these matters. Indeed, in the US:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>There is a regulatory framework on data protection for data collected or held by the Federal government</p></li><li><p>But there is no general framework on data protection outside the Federal government (states level).</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To remedy this situation, the Safe Harbor principles is an international agreement between the USA and EU which was put in place in 2000.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Safe Harbor  principles<sup>55</sup> are a series of regulations which US companies can agree to follow if they want to host EU personal data outside the EU. These rules provide a level of data protection equivalent to the one guaranteed by the 1995 Data Protection Directive in the EU.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In October 2015, Maximillian Schrems<sup>56</sup> (a student in law in Austria)  launched a lawsuit against Facebook for failure to protect his personal data against the spying of the NSA in the USA.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The defense of Facebook  was to argue that it complied with the Safe Harbor  Act. The lawsuit went to the European Court of Justice which ended up <strong>declaring the Safe Harbor  Act invalid</strong> because:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"legislation permitting the public authorities to have access on a generalized basis to the content of electronic communications must be regarded as compromising the essence of the fundamental right to respect for private life"."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The following months were a state of legal uncertainty as the EU data hosted on US servers were so under no legal conditions.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On 2nd February 2016, the EU and the US created a new legal agreement known as the EU-US Privacy Shield<sup>57</sup>. The the Privacy Shield differs from the Safe Harbor  Act<sup>58</sup> in the following:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><p>Stronger obligations on companies in the US to protect the personal data of Europeans' and stronger monitoring and enforcement by the US Department of Commerce and Federal Trade Commission.</p></li></ol></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic" start="2"><li><p>Access to personal data transferred under the new arrangement by public authorities on the US was scheduled to be subject to clear conditions, limitations and oversight, preventing generalized access by state surveillance organizations.</p></li></ol></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic" start="3"><li><p>Effective protection of EU citizens' rights with several redress possibilities.</p></li></ol></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic" start="4"><li><p>An annual joint review mechanism between the EU and the US.</p></li></ol></div></section>
<section><h3>c. GDPR, a new legal framework</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>The handling of EU citizen data outside of the EU is of a great legal complexity, as evidenced by the fragility of the EU-US legal agreements. Should the EU create special legal agreements with each and every country wishing for their companies to be able to host EU personal data? This seems like a bureaucratic nightmare (or a lawyer&#8217;s dream).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Instead, the EU has designed <strong>a new legal principle</strong> applying to all countries holding EU personal data, without the need for bilateral agreements. <strong>This is the GDPR</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation</strong> is a legal framework coming into place in 2018, replacing the 1995 Directive by a new, simple rule: EU citizen data must be handled according to the rules stated by the EU, <strong>wherever these data are stored or processed</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before examining the GDPR  in more details, we define the legal terms used in it:</p></div></section>
<section id="_key_definitions"><h2>Key definitions</h2></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Source for these key definitions : a synthetic whitepaper on the GDPR by Dataiku<sup>59</sup>. </p></div></section>
<section><h3>a. Personal data</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Personal data  is any information related to a human being (or data subject) that can be used to directly or indirectly identify that person.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example: name, photos, email addresses, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, IP addresses, etc.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>b. Sensitive data</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Sensitive data  is a special category of personal data (including personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and data concerning health or sex life) to which additional protections apply.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>c. Data subject</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>A data subject is a human being on whom personal data is being collected.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>d. Data controller (DC)</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>A data controller is an entity that determines the purposes, conditions, and means of the processing of personal data. When the organization is large enough, a dedicated position of "Data Controller" can be created.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ex: in France, the DC is in charge of declaring the personal data being processed to the CNIL<sup>60</sup>.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>e. Data processor (DP)</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>A data processor An entity that processes personal data on behalf of the controller (e.g., cloud and data center providers).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Until 2017, it was considered that the data processor is just "executing" the mission given by the DC:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>the DP is in charge of proper security measures to ensure data protection against breach, loss&#8230;&#8203;</p></li><li><p>but the DP is not liable for the improper collection procedures of personal data set up by the data controller.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Starting in 2018 with the GDPR (see next), the DP is co-responsible with the DC in case of a data breach compromising the personal data of subjects.</p></div></section>
<section id="_four_key_principles_for_the_rightful_processing_of_personal_data"><h2>Four key principles for the rightful processing of personal data</h2></section>
<section><h3>a. Prior consent</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Prior consent  is required before collecting personal data in view of processing it:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>Data collection policy should be made clearly available to users</p></li><li><p>Opt out should be possible</p></li><li><p>Consent should be presented clearly</p></li></ul></div></section>
<section><h3>b. Adequacy / legitimate purpose</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>The data collected should be exactly necessary to run the service, not more.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Time out: information should be deleted when service stops. In France, there is a 13 month limit after which consent must be renewed.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>c. Portability</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>&#8594; Information should be available on request </p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In 2011 Max Schrems requested all his Facebook  data. He received 1,200 pages of it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks to his efforts, now most of social media offer a one-click download of your personal data.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Portability also covers the "right to be forgotten", detailed in this factsheet by the EU<sup>61</sup>.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>d. Safety</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>All reasonable precautions should be taken against data breaches.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Precautions taken should be scaled to the damage which would result from a breach in security.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Basics: define and manage access rights to each relevant aspects of the data.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Users should be told about security breaches potentially affecting their data</p></div></section>
<section id="_in_2018_the_gdpr_and_what_it_changes"><h2>In 2018: the GDPR and what it changes</h2></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>GDPR  stands for "General Data Protection Regulation". It was adopted by the EU on April 14, 2016 and is enforced on <strong>May 25, 2018</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Its key novelties, compared to the EU Data Protection Directive, are:</p></div></section>
<section><h3>a. Application</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>The GDPR  applies to any company (regardless of their location, size, and sector) processing the personal data of people residing in the EU.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, a US-based company processing the personal data within the United States of EU citizens is required to comply.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>b. Responsibility</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Under the GDPR, both the data controller and the data processor must comply with the legislation. Under the previous/current Data Protection Directive, only data controllers were held liable for data protection compliance, not data processors.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>c. Penalties</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>With a maximum fine of up to 4 percent of annual global turnover or €20 million (whichever is greater), penalties for non-compliance are steep.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>d. Consent</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Under the GDPR, companies will no longer be able to use long, illegible terms and conditions full of legalese; consent for collection and use of personal data must be in plain language and detail the purpose of data processing.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>e. Data breaches</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Increased regulation surrounding the disclosure of <strong>data breaches</strong> ; specifically, much quicker reporting is required (within 72 hours).</p></div></section>
<section><h3>f. Data Subjects’ Rights</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>EU data subjects have expanded rights when it comes to data protection, including:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>the <strong>right to be forgotten</strong>  (have their data erased),</p></li><li><p>the right to access (obtain information about exactly what data is being processed where and for what purpose),</p></li><li><p>and the right to data portability (receive a copy of the personal data concerning them).</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Citizens now also have the right to question and fight decisions that affect them that have been made on a purely algorithmic basis.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>g. Privacy by design</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Privacy by design</strong>  is a legal requirement to consider data privacy on the onset of all projects and initiatives, not as an afterthought.</p></div></section>
<section><h3>h. Data Protection Officer (DPO) Appointment</h3></section>
<section><div class="paragraph"><p>Controllers and processors whose core business is regular and systematic monitoring of data
subjects on a large scale or who deal with special categories of data will be required to appoint a DPO. The DPO may be appointed from within, hired, or contracted, but (among other specific requirements) (s)he must be an expert on data protection law and practices.</p></div></section>

<table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all" style="width:100%"><colgroup><col style="width:100%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">“Sports Gym” is a 30-year company owned by an investor with an objective of increasing the profitability of this asset, on a constant business perimeter. Sport Gym manages 123 fitness centers across the country. Each fitness center is a place where gym goers can exercise with machines, group activities and other equipments. There are three types of customers: members with a year-long subscription (350€ / year), members on a monthly plan (41€ / month), and visitors for the day (15€ / day). Its yearly revenue is 57 millions €.</p><p class="tableblock">Sports Gym’s revenues make it a sustainable business in the short to middle term, but several factors threaten its profitability:
Low level of customer loyalty. Customers visit their Sports Gym club because it is close but they would easily switch to a fitness center with lower prices and a convenient location.
Lack of brand attachment. Surveys have shown that customers and prospects do not perceive Sports Gym as a unique, specific brand. They tend to associate it with any other fitness club, including competitors with lower prices.
Lack of scalability within each fitness center due to 1) cost structure: personalized coaching by certified experts is limited by HR costs, 2) difficulty with capacity management: fitness machines and group activities are alternatively overcrowded or not used at all.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Select the 3 data sets which you think will provide most value for your project, and for each dataset, assign a mark between 1 and 5, 1 being the hardest and 5 the easiest for the following dimensions :
Machine readable: data that exists in a database or a comma-separated value (.csv) file is easier to read than if it is stored in a Word document or a .pdf.
Structured or not: Free text is harder to use than structured data stored in a database
Follows universal categories or is company-specific: data that follows standard categorization, like the ones provided by national and international statistics organizations (e.g. Eurostat) is easier to analyze than if the categorization is specific to your company
Time series: data that is collected regularly across time will provide better results in the long term than punctual data
Personal and sensitive data: The more personal and sensitive data is, the more constraints it generates (GDPR, etc.), and therefore the harder it is to use
Complete: the more complete the data, the easier it is to use</p></div>

Follow this iterative process:
Pick one of the datasets
Define how the selected dataset contributes to a service meeting the needs of your target users
Challenge the results:
Is the solution still aligned with your company’s strategic objectives ?
Is the user really gaining value from the solution ?
If the dataset stands the challenge, you can keep it and move on to the next one. If it doesn’t, discard it and replace it.
